```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
</div>
```
This code will not work as expected because the `w-1/2` class tries to make each div take up half the width of its parent.  However, since there's no explicit width on the parent `div`, it will default to only as wide as its contents.  The two child divs then fight for that space, leading to unexpected results.
